This is the daily pageviews to a webpage since the start of 2022. Note that traffic to the page has weekly seasonality and a slight upwards trend. Also note that there are some days with anomalous traffic. Devise a methodology or write code to predict the daily pageviews to this page from now until the middle of next year. It doesn't have to be particularly polished - an outline will do. Justify any choices of data sets or sofware libraries considered.


time series data to predict the daily price from now until the middle of next year.



Here is an outline for a methodology to predict the daily pageviews to a webpage with weekly seasonality and a slight upwards trend:

Collect and preprocess the data:

Gather the daily pageview data from the webpage from the start of 2022 to the current date.
Clean and format the data as necessary.
Create new features such as day of the week, month, etc. to capture the weekly seasonality.
Explore the data:

Visualize the data to identify any patterns, trends or anomalies.
Check for stationarity of the time series data, if not, make it stationary.
Determine the appropriate time series model (e.g. ARIMA, SARIMA,ETS,Prophet etc) based on the exploratory analysis.
Train the model:

Split the data into train and test sets.
Fit the chosen model to the training data.
Use the test set to evaluate the performance of the model.
Make predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions for the daily pageviews from now until the middle of next year.
Validate the predictions:

Compare the predicted values with the actual values for the test set.
Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error.
Deploy the model:
-Deploy the model in a production environment to make predictions in real-time.

In this case, I would recommend using Prophet which is a well-documented and widely used library for time series forecasting, specifically designed for business time-series data. The library has built-in support for handling holidays, weekly seasonality, and trend changes.



# import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from fbprophet import Prophet

# read in the data from a csv file
df = pd.read_csv('pageviews_data.csv')

# convert the date column to a datetime object
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# set the date column as the index
df.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# rename the column with pageviews data
df.rename(columns={'pageviews': 'y'}, inplace=True)

# create a Prophet model and add weekly seasonality
m = Prophet(weekly_seasonality=True)
m.fit(df)

# create a dataframe to hold future predictions
future = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=365)

# make predictions
forecast = m.predict(future)

# plot the forecast
m.plot(forecast)


This code assumes that your data is in a csv file named pageviews_data.csv with columns date and pageviews. The date column should be in a format that can be converted to a datetime object using the pd.to_datetime() function.

This will create a forecast with daily granularity, including predictions for the weekly seasonality and a slight upward trend. You can also access the prediction by forecast['yhat']

Also, it would be a good idea to split the data into train and test set and validate the model using evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error.

Here is the python code which will implement the methodology mentioned above using the Prophet library.

# set the date column as the index
df.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# rename the column with pageviews data
df.rename(columns={'pageviews': 'y'}, inplace=True)

#Splitting the data into train and test set
train_data = df.iloc[:int(df.shape[0]*0.8)]
test_data = df.iloc[int(df.shape[0]*0.8):]

# create a Prophet model and add weekly seasonality
m = Prophet(weekly_seasonality=True)
m.fit(train_data)

# create a dataframe to hold future predictions
future = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=365)

# make predictions
forecast = m.predict(future)

# evaluate the model
predictions = forecast.iloc[-len(test_data):]['yhat']
mae = mean_absolute_error(test_data['y'], predictions)
rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(test_data['y'], predictions))

print('MAE:', mae)
print('RMSE:', rmse)

# plot the forecast
m.plot(forecast)
